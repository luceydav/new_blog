      <description>Introduction This post will be a continuation of Parsing of Mass Municipal PDF CAFR’s with Tabulizer, pdftools and AWS Textract - Part 1 dealing with extracting data from PDFs using R. When Redwall discovered pdftools, and its pdf_data function, which maps out every word on a pdf page by x-y coordinate, we thought that was interesting, but didn’t really know how to use it.</description>

      <description>Introduction Redwall Analytics had the pleasure of collaborating with Marc Joffe, of Reason Foundation, in its October 2018 post Replicating Yankee Institute Risk Score Over 15 Years for 150 Connecticut towns. This involved taking a well organized public dataset from the State’s website, and analyzing it in R. When Marc called to ask if we could report on our blog site about similar analysis for 150 Massachusetts towns, as in Connecticut’s Warning Signs, we jumped at the idea.</description>

      <description>Introduction As financial professionals and analytic software lovers, the ability to efficiently load a large number of financial statements, and conduct an analysis has always been a key objective. In previous posts, Redwall Analytics worked with a 15-year time series of municipal Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR) for 15 Fairfield County, CT towns Fairfield County Town Level Spending and Liabilities Gallop Since 2001. We also studied the worrisome long-term, time series of unfunded liabilities for all 169 Connecticut municipalities Connecticut City Unfunded Pension And OPEB Liabilities.</description>

      <description># Re-load data previously stored for purposes of this blog post pharma &amp;lt;- fread(&amp;quot;~/Desktop/David/Projects/xbrl_investment/data/pharma_inc.csv&amp;quot;) Introduction In A Walk Though of Accessing Financial Statements with XBRL in R - Part 1, we went through the first steps of pulling XBRL data for a single company from Edgar into R. Although an improvement over manual plugging of numbers into a Excel, there is still a way to go to having clean comparable numbers, and several of challenges were discussed.</description>

      <description>Introduction The State of Connecticut is required to test all of its students over the course of their academic careers. The data by year and school is disclosed as it becomes available at the State Department of Education’s Edsight website. In keeping with its explorations of open CT data, one of Redwall Analytics’s projects is to look for insight in this kind of disclosure.</description>

      <description>Warning Signs - Part II As mentioned in part I of this series Connecticut City Unfunded Pension and OPEB Liabilities Over Time, we intend to look at the evolution of city financial vulnerability over time. The metric put forth in the Yankee report used a methodology developed by Marc Joffe of the Reason Foundation in two pieces.
Mr. Joffe’s first piece Assessing Municipal Bond Default Probabilities looked in depth at the conditions which led to municipal bankruptcies during the Great Depression when they were most common, and the handful of more recent special cases.</description>

      <description>Introduction - Part I Earlier this year, Reviewing Fairfield County Municipal Fiscal Indicators Since 2001 looked at data from 17 annual Connecticut Municipal Fiscal Indicators reports to better understand the current financial condition of all 169 towns. Those reports included only began including the net pension liability over the last three years and had no OPEB data. It turns out that the same disclosure by the Office of Policy Management includes separate tables for pension and other post employment benefits (OPEB).</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will be using the same dataset as our earlier: IRS Data Shows Growth in Number not Income of Highest Earners since 2005. This dataset encompases 2.2 million rows of five brackets for each zip code from 2005-2016. Using actual tax data, we noted that despite the robust political dialogue, income inequality has been declining nationally and in Connecticut since 2007.</description>

      <description>Introduction In an earlier post, Reviewing Fairfield County Municipal Fiscal Indicators Since 2001, we used 17 years of individual Town Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR) aggregated in Connecticut’s Municipal Fiscal Indicator’s to compare 15 Fairfield County towns. The challenge was that the graphs became crowded even with that small number of towns. In this analysis, we will expand our look at the similar variables over all 169 Connecticut towns using Geo-spatial mapping.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this study, Redwall Analytics looks at 12 years of adjusted gross income data from over 140 million annual tax returns across the US and compare to Connecticut returns over five income brackets. We find a few suprising trends:
 Despite being the highest income state, mean income of Connecticut’s &amp;lt;$25k income group is at the bottom of all 50 states (though it had the smallest percentage of taxpayers in that bracket).</description>

      <guid>/2019/01/09/analysis-of-connecticut-tax-load-by-income-bracket/</guid>
      <description>Introduction This brief study finds that Connecticut residents pay $62-63 billion annually in total taxes (including: Federal, State, Municipal Real Estate, Sales, FICA, Medicare) on adjusted gross income of $165-167 billion (an effective tax rate of 37-38%). Some taxes, such as FICA and Medicare, might be considered forms of savings or insurance with a future benefit, and local real estate tax funding education might offset tuition expenses (if the taxpayer’s children can high quality public schools).</description>

      <description>Introduction In recent weeks, we have been exploring the State of Connecticut’s municipal oversight infrastructure. Every year, each of the 169 towns files an audited Comprehensive Annual Report (CAFR) and the state aggregates these into the Municipal Fiscal Indicators report Municipal Fiscal Indicators - Fiscal Years Ended 2012-2017. The report is a rich source of information for comparing municipal health.</description>

      <description>Introduction Redwall Analytics has spent the last couple of months gathering data from the State of Connecticut’s relatively new “open data initiative”. In recent months, we have made several posts on LinkedIn describing our explorations and looking at the some of the financial challenges faced by our home state: Quick Review of State of Connecticut Spending in the R Stats Language and Independent Confirmation of the Yankee Institute Study on Gold Coast Real Estate Assessments.</description>
