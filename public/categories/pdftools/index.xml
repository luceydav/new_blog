      <description>Introduction When Redwall discovered pdftools, and its pdf_data function, which maps out every word on a pdf page by x-y coordinate, we thought that was interesting, but didn’t really know how to use it. We also didn’t have the regular expression skills, and were much more befuddled by the nested list structures than we are now.
As for Tabulizer, it took about a year before rJava magically started working properly, but even then we it wasn’t possible to consistently read a large number of tables of different sizes without cutting off fields in unexpected ways.</description>
