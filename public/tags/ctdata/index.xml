      <description>Introduction This post will be a continuation of Parsing of Mass Municipal PDF CAFR’s with Tabulizer, pdftools and AWS Textract - Part 1 dealing with extracting data from PDFs using R. When Redwall discovered pdftools, and its pdf_data function, which maps out every word on a pdf page by x-y coordinate, we thought that was interesting, but didn’t really know how to use it.</description>

      <description>Introduction Redwall Analytics had the pleasure of collaborating with Marc Joffe, of Reason Foundation, in its October 2018 post Replicating Yankee Institute Risk Score Over 15 Years for 150 Connecticut towns. This involved taking a well organized public dataset from the State’s website, and analyzing it in R. When Marc called to ask if we could report on our blog site about similar analysis for 150 Massachusetts towns, as in Connecticut’s Warning Signs, we jumped at the idea.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, we will be using the same dataset as our earlier: IRS Data Shows Growth in Number not Income of Highest Earners since 2005. This dataset encompases 2.2 million rows of five brackets for each zip code from 2005-2016. Using actual tax data, we noted that despite the robust political dialogue, income inequality has been declining nationally and in Connecticut since 2007.</description>

      <description>Introduction In an earlier post, Reviewing Fairfield County Municipal Fiscal Indicators Since 2001, we used 17 years of individual Town Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR) aggregated in Connecticut’s Municipal Fiscal Indicator’s to compare 15 Fairfield County towns. The challenge was that the graphs became crowded even with that small number of towns. In this analysis, we will expand our look at the similar variables over all 169 Connecticut towns using Geo-spatial mapping.</description>
